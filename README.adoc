== Timbuctoo mappings

This repository contains RML mappings to convert tabular data into rdf.
A mapping defines which properties to convert, what predicates they should map to, and how to turn foreign keys into URI's.

The mappings are usually written using http://jsonnet.org/docs/tutorial.html[jsonnet]. Please read the link:./mapping-generator[mapping generator guide] to learn more.
This repo also contains a node.js script that wraps the timbuctoo API calls and makes it easy to upload data and apply the mappings.

To execute the script, you need 

 - a node.js that's at least 8.4.0
 - the `jsonnet` executable somewhere on your $PATH

You can launch the script using 

```
timbuctooUrl=http://data.anansi.clariah.nl node ./execute.js
```

You should of course replace the timbuctoo url with whatever you're using.
